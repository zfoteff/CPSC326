Prolog Day 2
==============

## Recall
* Prolog programs build from facts and rules
  * Facts are defined first
  * rules are defined later
* Prolog is agnostic about inputs and outputs
  * Everything is an input output or both

## Prolog Rules and Facts
* A Fact is an assertion
* Example of <u>Ground Clause:</u>  
`
mother (necessity, invention).
`
  * Asserts this is true
  * Both arguments are atoms
* A rule can generate new facts from existing Facts  
```
parent(X, Y) :- mother (X, Y).  
parent(X, Y) :- father (X, Y).  
human_parent(X, Y ) :- parent(X, Y), human(X).
```
* Also have three logical operators "OR" "AND" "\\" or not
* If the right is true, then the left can be derived as a fact
  * `<head> :- <body>`
  * Entire statement is called a <u>Clause</u>

## Different model of computation
`p(X, Z) :- q(X, Y), r(Y, Z).` -> Transitive Property
* <u>Bottom-up computation:</u> read rules/clauses from right to left
  * "Database" view of Prolog
  * Very good at handling recursion & negation through recursion
  `p(x) :- ~p(x)`
* <u>Top-down computation:</u> read rules/clauses from left to right using proof trees

## Proof Trees
* Used during top down computation
```
mother (necessity, invention).
mother (june, wally).
?- parent(X, Y). -> This is known as the goal
    -> mother (X,Y) -> will now match this with a fact "unfolding step"
    -> mother(necessity, invention)
      x = necessity, Y = invention  -> "unifying step" ;
    -> mother (june, wally)
      X = june, Y = wally ;
    -> father (X, Y) -> subgoal of parent fact
```
* The goal trys to pattern match facts that concern parents with facts that match

### Unfolding
* When we "unfold" we apply a form of substitution  
`Rule 1: E <- C ^ D`  
`Rule 2: C <- A ^ B`  
* We can substitute rule C in R1 with A ^ B in R2  
`Rule 1: E <- A ^ B ^ D`  
* This step is entire basis of why Prolog became a programming language
* Based on <u>resolution</u> inference rule: p->q = ~p or q  
`Rule 1: C and D -> E = ~(C and D) or E = ~C or ~D or E`
* This is now in <u>clausal form</u>
* Trickier with variables  
`E(x) -> C(x) ^ D(x)`  
`C(y) -> A(y) ^ B(y, z)`  

### Unification
* What allows us to do pattern matching with Prolog
* '=' indicates unity
* Rules:
  1. A constant unifies w/ itself
    * (1 = 1) == true, (a = a) == true, (a = b) == false
  1. Two structures unify if:
    * They have the same functor -> p(a) = p(a) == true
    * Terms have to unify -> p(a) = p(b) == false
    * They have to have the same airity -> (p(a) = p(a, b)) == false
  1. A variable unifies w/ any other term
    * if term is a constant, then we say the variable is instantiated -> (X = a) == true, (a = X) == true
    * if term is another uninstantiated variable, then it becomes linked to same variable
    ```
    (X = Y) == true
    (Y = a) == true
    (X = b) == false -> Since X was linked to Y it was also instantiated to the value a
    ```
    * if term is a structure, variable is instantiated to it  
    `r(a, b) = r(X, Y) == true -> X is instantiated to a, Y is instantiated to b`  
    `r(a, b) = r(X, X) == false-> X is instantiated to b, then try to unify b with X which fails`  
    `r(X, s(a,b)) = r(Y, Z) == true -> Y = X, Z = s(a,b)`  

### Making a proof tree
```
/*  facts   */
food(X) :- edible(X), nutritious(X).  //  (1)
edible(twinkie).                      //  (2)
edible(apple).                        //  (3)
nutritious(apple).                    //  (4)

/*  Rules   */
//  Start of tree
?- food(F).       -> goal or Root Node
                |
         /   |     |   \
       F=X Null Null Null
      /
[edible(X), nutritious(X)]
  /     |             |
Null X=twinkie       X=apple
        |                 \
    [nutritious(twinkie)] [nutritious(apple)]
      /    |    |   \       /    |    |   \
    Null  Null Null Null   Null Null Null []
                                          |
                                          F=apple
```
* Recall that if a semicolon is used, the next match is called and it will keep looking through the tree for more answers

```
/*  Facts   */
p(x) :- p(x), q(x)
q(a).
p(a).

/*  Rules   */
//  Start of tree
?- p(X)
                              [p(X)]
                            /   |    \
                  [p(x),q(x)]  ...   ...
                /     |     \
[p(x), q(x), q(x)]    ...   ...
    ..........................................................

    Infinite recursion unless recursive step is on the right-most branch
```

##  Prolog Arithmetic operations
```
?- x = 2+3.
 | x = 2+3
?- x = +(2,3).
 | x = 5
?- x is 2+3.
 | x = 5
```

### Operations
* -
* *
* +
* / (float div)
* // (int div)
* %
* Comparison operators
  * Equality: 1 == 1
  * Not Equality: 1 \\== 2
  * Less than: 1 < 2
  * Greater than: 2 > 1
  * Greater than equal: 2 >= 1
  * Less than equal: 1 =< 2
